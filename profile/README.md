## What is Adobe Character Animator?

**Adobe Character Animator** is a powerful animation tool that enables real-time character animation through motion capture. Using your camera and microphone, the software captures facial expressions, body movements, and voice to animate 2D puppets instantly. This revolutionary approach eliminates the need for manual keyframing, making it ideal for live performances, streaming, and rapid content creation.

Character Animator is widely used by animators, streamers, educators, and digital artists to create engaging and interactive characters. Its seamless integration with other Adobe Creative Cloud apps like Photoshop and After Effects allows for a smooth workflow from design to animation. Whether you're producing animated shorts, live broadcasts, or educational videos, Character Animator offers a unique blend of simplicity and professional capability.
